# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Introduction
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Hotel Bookings dataset to uncover insights about customer booking behavior, seasonal trends, and factors that influence hotel reservations.

The analysis involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing booking patterns using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Analysis Performed
Data Cleaning

Dropped columns with excessive missing values (agent, company)

Handled missing data appropriately

Exploratory Analysis

Distribution of bookings by hotel type (Resort vs. City Hotel)

Seasonal booking trends

Cancellations and their impact

Market segment and distribution channel analysis

Visualizations

Bar charts and histograms for categorical features

Line plots for seasonal trends

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

## Key Insights
Significant number of bookings are from City Hotels compared to Resort Hotels.

Seasonality plays a big role in hotel demand, with peaks during holidays.

Cancellations form a noticeable portion of total bookings.

Distribution channels such as TA/TO (Travel Agents/Tour Operators) dominate booking sources.
